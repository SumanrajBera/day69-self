# Self Task: Coding Gravity with canvas
- This experiment is about how to implement gravity with circles in canvas
- Here we learned basically what is gravity and how we apply it to objects.
- When an element falls from a certain distance along y-axis it increases its speed and if we add a single value per frame then it looks linear and not like gravity.
- Then comes friction which is used to decrease the value of velocity which happens on real objects and friction is added only when it touches the bottom.
- With these two things we can code gravity.
